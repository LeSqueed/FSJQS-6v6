# FSJQS-6v6

FSJQS was based on the [6v6 Adjustments](https://github.com/6v6-Adjustments/6v6-adjustments), but all new additions were done in the workshop itself.
This is an attempt to convert it back to a maintainable project using opy.
Due to challenges of updating their code to work with the changes already made in the workshop itself I've decided to restart with a fresh decompile from Overwatch's Workshop code. This is very much still a work in progress as I am moving parts over to their own files from a massive main.opy. Referencing both the original source code and the changes made in the workshop itself.

For build instructions, see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

Most of the additional work on top of the changes in the 6v6 Adjustments code was done by xDidact in collaboration with [Realth](https://www.twitch.tv/realth) and his community. The balance changes are being used in the weekly PUGS every Sunday.
